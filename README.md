# Basic of React Native

## Basic concept
    - SafeAreaView and Provider
    - StyleSheet
    - Props: Any but need to be text to display, if function then calling should be done in the new function of its component
    - Conditional Rendering: When value is changed it re-render the changed component
    - State: useState to manage state, pass it to the childern
    - Unexpected Behaviour of state: set state require to be the function of the component to change
